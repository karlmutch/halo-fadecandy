# Poke Halo - fadecandy server

## Description

Config and deployment for Fadecandy server (running on as Raspberry PI)

## Prerequisites
Trying to use Salt with a Raspberry PI is a fools errand. Therefore there will be a little bit of manual setup required:

1.Install supervisor
2. Create an empty folder in `/etc` called `supervisord` - this is because our velcro script assumes supervisor is installed here.
3. Create a symlink to `/etc/supervisor/supervisor.conf` in this new folder
4. Recreate the standard Poke folder structures:

    /poke/software/
    /poke/data/app/poke/halo/
    /poke/data/conf/supervisord/

### 1. Checkout fadecandy repo

Checkout the repo from

https://github.com/pokelondon/fadecandy to the `/poke/software/` folder on the pi (i.e. into a folder with path /poke/software/fadecandy/)
